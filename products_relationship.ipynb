    "# Amazon Products Relevance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Our goad is to find out the relationship between any two products in Amazon. For example, if a person buys package of coffee bean, s/he might also buy a set of filter papers. We can see the coffee beans is somehow connected to the filter papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "The strategy we are using to analyze is based on [Combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination). The products that being bought by a user at the same month will be collected in to a [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics))(as product's id). We will get the combination(choose 2) from the set and count the number of each combination. The set will be sorted first to avoid the cases having identical elements but in different order(like (A, B) and (B, A)). Next, we will also have each product's count where how many users have bought the product. And we take the [Intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection) as the relevance of any two products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Say a person A left reviews for products {X, Y, Z} in the same month. Another person B left reviews for {K, X, Z}. The combination for A is {(X, Y), (X, Z), (Y, Z)}, and {(K, X), (K, Z), (X, Z)} for B. The counts of c(X), c(Z), and c({X, Z}) are all 2. We can have the intersection between X and Z\n",
    "```\n",
    "2 / (2 + 2 - 2) = 100%. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The dividend is c({X, Z}), and the divisor is x(X) + c(Z) - c({X, Z}).  So now we can give X and Z a 100% relevance score.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We also can have the relevance between X and Y. \n",
    "```\n",
    "c({X, Y}) / c(x) + c(y) - c({X, Y}) = 50%\n",
    "(c(x) =2, c(y)=1 and c({X, Y}) = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-process\n",
    "Because amazon's review are really huge(126GB) so we need pre-preproces \n",
    "The pre-prcess is introduced in ....\n",
